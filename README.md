Project Title:
---------------
Short-Term Effects and Forecasting on the FX Market in Response to US Macroeconomic Data Releases

Project Description:
--------------------
This project explores the short-term impact of major US macroeconomic events on the foreign exchange (FX) market. It involves data collection, event-centric analysis, statistical and AI-based prediction models (GARCH and LSTM), as well as performance evaluations through KPIs and Monte Carlo bounds. The analysis identifies key macroeconomic drivers of volatility and forecasts FX reactions to these events.
